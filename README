These are the files in my vim directory. They are all openly redistributable,
but the copyright on most of them is not mine. Specifically, most of the
.gvimrc, .vimrc, syntax stuff is of my own making, but the following projects
are included:
 - Vim-LaTeX package
 - Doxygen, Markdown, MCNP etc. syntax highlighting (various authors)
 - "kellys" colorscheme

All files marked with my name are released into the public domain.

The "notvim" folder is really not vim at all: I just have some of my other
config files stored for easy retrieval.

INSTRUCTIONS
------------

The simple makefile copies everything to your home folder and vice-versa.

	git clone git://github.com/sethrj/SRJ-Vim-Resources.git myvim
	cd myvim
	make install
	# modify stuff in ~/.vimrc etc.
	make rinstall
	git commit -a
